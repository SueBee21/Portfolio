            <p class="float-left">After over 15 years working in healthcare and community non-profit organizations as a clinical social worker, I am excited to take my problem-solving skills into a new line of work. Although I only recently entered the world of coding, I have found myself quickly immersed and eager to learm more about the creative potential of programming languages. 
            </p>
            <p>I am an avid and adventerous learner, recognizing that there is great value in choosing to actively pursue chalenges in life.  In recent years I have dedicated my focus to pursue challenges in physical endurence - having completed marathons, triathalons, mountain and trail races in the past 6 years.  I am also a dabbeling musician, having learned violin, guitar, and clarinet in younger years, and recently choosing to learn the viola.  It was in this pursuit, where I was challenged to learn to read music in a new clef, that I discovered the value of expanding my mind in new directions.  In this same vein, I am excited to take on this new challenge to learn programming langauges and begin a new career in the expanding world of tech.   
                </p>
                <p>I am currently in enrolled in Univerity of Connecticut's Coding Bootcamp to pursue a certificate in full stack program devleopment, excpeted completion in January 2021.</p>
